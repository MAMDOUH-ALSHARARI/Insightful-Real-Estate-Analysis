The method to deal with them would then depend on the reason of their occurrence.\n","\n","Let’s understand various types of outliers:\n","\n","1. Data Entry Errors:- Human errors such as errors caused during data collection, recording, or entry can cause outliers in data.\n","2. Measurement Error: It is the most common source of outliers. This is caused when the measurement instrument used turns out to be faulty.\n","3. Data Processing Error: Whenever we perform data mining, we extract data from multiple sources. It is possible that some manipulation or extraction errors may lead to outliers in the dataset.\n","4. Sampling error: For instance, we have to measure the height of athletes. By mistake, we include a few basketball players in the sample. This inclusion is likely to cause outliers in the dataset.\n","5. Natural Outlier: When an outlier is not artificial (due to error), it is a natural outlier. For instance: In my last assignment with one of the renowned insurance company, I noticed that the performance of top 50 financial advisors was far higher than rest of the population. Surprisingly, it was not due to any error. Hence, whenever we perform any data mining activity with advisors, we used to treat this segment separately.\n","\n","\n","**What is the impact of Outliers on a dataset?**\n","\n","\n","![image.png](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Outlier_31.png)\n","\n","\n","\n","**How to detect Outliers?**\n","\n","1. Most commonly used method to detect outliers is visualization (Univariate Graphical Analysis).\n","\n","We use 3 common visualization methods:\n",">- Box-plot: A box plot is a method for graphically depicting groups of numerical data through their quartiles. The box extends from the Q1 to Q3 quartile values of the data, with a line at the median (Q2). The whiskers extend from the edges of the box to show the range of the data. Outlier points are those past the end of the whiskers. Box plots show robust measures of location and spread as well as providing information about symmetry and outliers.\n",">\n",">  \n",">![image.png](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:698/format:webp/1*VK5iHA2AB28HSZwWwUbNYg.png)\n",">\n",">\n",">- Histogram\n",">- Scatter Plot: A scatter plot is a mathematical diagram using Cartesian coordinates to display values for two variables for a set of data.

Any value which out of range of 5th and 95th percentile can be considered as outlier\n",">- Data points, three or more standard deviation away from mean are considered outlier: The Z-score is the signed number of standard deviations by which the value of an observation or data point is above the mean value of what is being observed or measured. While calculating the Z-score we re-scale and center the data and look for data points that are too far from zero. These data points which are way too far from zero will be treated as the outliers. In most of the cases, a threshold of 3 or -3 is used i.e if the Z-score value is greater than or less than 3 or -3 respectively, that data point will be identified as outliers.\n","> - Outlier detection is merely a special case of the examination of data for influential data points and it also depends on the business understanding\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"74ea6194-cc01-45d8-be38-c4543eb1714e","metadata":{"id":"74ea6194-cc01-45d8-be38-c4543eb1714e"},"outputs":[],"source":["# go to univariate graphical analysis\n","# go to lesson : data visualisation 1 - chart type section\n","# then go to univariate graphical analysis\n","# detect outliers using graphs varbaly"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"48ecf77b-480c-4f64-9485-95be805bc357","metadata":{"id":"48ecf77b-480c-4f64-9485-95be805bc357"},"outputs":[],"source":["# go to lesson: statistics 1 then statistics 3\n","# then go to univariate Non graphical analysis\n","# detect outliers using numerical statistics"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"ee200da8-62b0-492d-b118-f4d665a1fb16","metadata":{"id":"ee200da8-62b0-492d-b118-f4d665a1fb16"},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"4e66d611-6958-4860-8522-9ada7fce40b0","metadata":{"id":"4e66d611-6958-4860-8522-9ada7fce40b0"},"outputs":[],"source":["# go to delete ouliers"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"4e886ec7-388c-414b-ada7-803c2fb1f2cb","metadata":{"id":"4e886ec7-388c-414b-ada7-803c2fb1f2cb"},"source":["## 2.

Mean/ Mode/ Median Imputation: It consists of replacing the missing data for a given attribute by the mean or median (quantitative attribute) or mode (qualitative attribute) of all known values of that variable.\n","    > It can be of two types:\n","    > - Generalized Imputation: In this case, we calculate the mean or median for all non missing values of that variable then replace missing value with mean or median.\n","    > - Similar case Imputation: In this case, we calculate average for each group individually of non missing values then replace the missing value based on the group.\n","\n","    2.2. Constant Value\n","   \n","    2.3. Forward Filling\n","   \n","    2.4. Backward Filling\n","\n","6. Prediction Model:  Prediction model is one of the sophisticated method for handling missing data. Here, we create a predictive model to estimate values that will substitute the missing data.  In this case, we divide our data set into two sets: One set with no missing values for the variable and another one with missing values. First data set become training data set of the model while second data set with missing values is test data set and variable with missing values is treated as target variable. Next, we create a model to predict target variable based on other attributes of the training data set and populate missing values of test data set.\n","\n","> There are 2 drawbacks for this approach:\n","> - The model estimated values are usually more well-behaved than the true values\n","> - If there are no relationships with attributes in the data set and the attribute with missing values, then the model will not be precise for estimating missing values.\n","\n","9. KNN Imputation: In this method of imputation, the missing values of an attribute are imputed using the given number of attributes that are most similar to the attribute whose values are missing. The similarity of two attributes is determined using a distance function. It is also known to have certain advantage & disadvantages.\n","\n","   > **Advantages:**\n","   > - k-nearest neighbour can predict both qualitative & quantitative attributes\n","   > - Creation of predictive model for each attribute with missing data is not required\n","   > - Attributes with multiple missing values can be easily treated\n","   > - Correlation structure of the data is taken into consideration\n","\n","   > **Disadvantage:**\n","   > - KNN algorithm is very time-consuming in analyzing large database. It searches through all the dataset looking for the most similar instances.\n","   > - Choice of k-value is very critical. Higher value of k would include attributes which are significantly different from what we need whereas lower value of k implies missing out of significant attributes.\n","\n","--------------------\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"57e741fb-71c1-46ad-a526-d8f0b1564dc3","metadata":{"id":"57e741fb-71c1-46ad-a526-d8f0b1564dc3"},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"01287962-8077-4c01-8d1d-5f8aed6cb37a","metadata":{"id":"01287962-8077-4c01-8d1d-5f8aed6cb37a"},"outputs":[],"source":["# go back to 6th dimention --> Completeness"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f7cee10f-0af8-44e5-b595-8e965294daad","metadata":{"id":"f7cee10f-0af8-44e5-b595-8e965294daad"},"source":["### Correcting errors\n","\n","-------------------"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"06273b88-a169-42e8-81f5-5d71cb3f9c21","metadata":{"id":"06273b88-a169-42e8-81f5-5d71cb3f9c21"},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"f1d95da5-a3ba-473a-8243-aa177cadae20","metadata":{"id":"f1d95da5-a3ba-473a-8243-aa177cadae20"},"outputs":[],"source":["# go back to 7th dimension Accuracy"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"5ecc7dbb-6867-44cf-8f99-1b969a80be40","metadata":{"id":"5ecc7dbb-6867-44cf-8f99-1b969a80be40"},"source":["### Dealing with outliers:"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"88347887-4bdf-48af-9486-cb8fe80c97af","metadata":{"id":"88347887-4bdf-48af-9486-cb8fe80c97af"},"source":["**How to remove Outliers?**\n","Most of the ways to deal with outliers are similar to the methods of missing values like deleting rows, transforming them, binning them, treat them as a separate group, imputing values and other statistical methods.

Deleting rows: We delete outlier values if it is due to data entry error, data processing error or outlier rows are very small in numbers. We can also use trimming at both ends to remove outliers.\n","\n","2. Imputing: Like imputation of missing values, we can also impute outliers. We can use mean, median, mode imputation methods. Before imputing values, we should analyse if it is natural outlier or artificial. If it is artificial, we can go with imputing values. We can also use statistical model to predict values of outlier rows and after that we can impute it with predicted values.\n","\n","3.
